# dat_fix
Collection of tools to scan and repair wav files from a DAT transfer to detect and correct drop-outs

Scan a wav file from a DAT transfer for drop outs.  These seem to manifest as regions of repeated samples. 
The thresh parameter adjusts the threshold number of repeated samples to be considered a drop out.

## modules

### scan_file

```python
def scan_file( self, fname, thresh=100 ):
        """
        " scan the specified wave file for sequences of duplicated
        " samples of length greater than thresh. These sequences
        " are assumed to be drop-outs resulting from imperfect
        " playback of a DAT tape
        "
        " input:
        "   fname: filename to scan
        "   thresh: <optional> threshold length of dropout sequences in samples.
        "           default: 100, although 50, 25, 20 also seem to perform reas>onably well
        "           low thresh values (<10) risk false positives generated by real
        "           content of the wave file (possibly low frequency or low volume sections)
        "
        " output:
        "   diagnostics printed to stdout
        """

# TODO
[ ]  tool to compare multiple takes from the same transfer and find the number of samples to shift to align them

[ ]  handle multiple takes/files, align them, detect drop out regions, and fill from takes without dropouts.
